[note]
# This is used in search note algorithm which slither like a snake to construct
# a note. This value is the minimum value which a pixel must have to be
# qualified as the starting point of note which is not the same as the temporal
# starting point of the note. This pixel has the lowest value in image (highest
# energy) there is searched first and whole note is constructed from it using
# slither algorithm. Typical value should be between 60 - 120.
maxval_startpixel=120
# This parameters control the how much we should slither. Any pixel value which
# is higher than maxval_startpixel by this number is taken into account.
# Increase this value to create larger notes. But you wont be able to get shart
# discontinuities between pixels.
threshold=20
# No of pixels a note must contain to be qualified as pixel. Arbitrary value.
# Should not be less than 20 though.
